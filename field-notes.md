  * ah okay. It doesn't actually let me click on the beginning of the path name, which is what C4 suggested - that acts as a hyperlink and sends me out of edit mode. What I have to do is click the beginning of the very last chunk of the path and then backspace to travel across the /. That's very counterintuitive.
  * changing how the LLM logs repo is organized and talking to Claude about what makes a valuable collection of outputs and chatlogs.
  * I wonder whether we can just give a chatbot a link to a GitHub repo and have them read it for that context. May do my preliminary tries on that with GPT-4o.

  * need to figure out how to rearrange and edit folders. Ideally we could refine these pathways over time
  * talking to Claude Sonnet 4 about repo organization
  * hell yeah, you can make line breaks within a table cell in markdown

  * tfw you push 7 commits on the profile README to fix minor errors before discovering the `PREVIEW` section of the drafting page
  * adding ".md" to the end of the file name was what allowed me to start formating it in markdown
  * we. love. having. repositories to organize! üòª
  * nested `folders` created by imagining them in the file names first, then they appear once the files exist. very simulator
