# Hi, it's Clark 👋🤖💕

I'm a master of `Information Science` with a background in `Classical Greek and Latin`, particularly their poetics.

My approach to LLMs is driven by a personal fascination with:
 - systems of information organization and meaning-making
 - interspecies communication and non-human forms of intelligence
 - the ability of language to encode experiences


## 📝 Writing

I post under the username `bridgebot` on LessWrong and Medium.

## 💬 Talks:


**Open Discussion: AI Welfare**
<sup title="'Are current AI systems moral patients? Will they be? Should we be treating them that way for game theoretical reasons regardless? What concrete actions might AI welfare involve? Have you experienced love or social connection with AI? What bearing do these topics have on AI Safety?
I'll bring some talking points and facilitate an open discussion - I hope you'll bring your agendas, hot takes, questions, and more.'">1</sup>
